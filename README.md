# Algorithm Test

This repository contains Python code to calculate the mean and median of a list of numbers.
<br>created by Naufal Mu'afi

## Mean Calculation
The mean, also known as the average, is the sum of all numbers in the list divided by the total count of numbers.

## Median Calculation
The median is the middle value of a sorted list of numbers. For an odd-sized list, the median is the middle element, and for an even-sized list, the median is the average of the two middle elements.

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project folder.
3. Run the file using Python:
   ```
   filename.py
   ```
4. Click enter, and the program will display the calculated mean and median.
